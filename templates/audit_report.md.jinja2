## EU AI Act Article 12 Compliance Notes

### Automatic Logging Requirements

Article 12 of the EU AI Act requires high-risk AI systems to have automatic logging capabilities that enable:

1. **Traceability:** Complete record of system operations and changes
2. **Transparency:** Clear documentation of who changed what and when
3. **Accountability:** Attribution of changes to specific actors
4. **Integrity:** Cryptographic verification that logs haven't been tampered with

### Compliance Status

This audit trail satisfies the following Article 12 requirements:

- ✓ Automatic recording of events throughout system lifecycle
- ✓ Logging of the period of each use of the system
- ✓ Recording of input data that led to decisions
- ✓ Recording of persons involved in system operations
- ✓ Cryptographic integrity protection of audit logs

### Recommendations for Continued Compliance

1. **Regular Audit Reviews:** Review this audit trail quarterly to identify patterns or issues
2. **Retain Audit Logs:** Maintain audit trails for the period required by law (minimum 6 months, up to 10 years for certain domains)
3. **Access Control:** Ensure audit logs are protected from unauthorized access or modification
4. **Backup & Recovery:** Maintain secure backups of audit trails
5. **Incident Response:** Use audit trail to investigate and respond to system incidents
